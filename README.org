* alhg's .emacs file

Welcome to my emacs file.


* TODO/Ideas/bugs
- [TODO] Split up my init.el into multiple files for organization
- [TODO] Figure out the common lsp commands used and map them to make more convenient keybindings
  - Mainly need to figure out how to display doc information
- [Idea] (Crazy) Use evil modal keybindings, but when in insert use emacs keybindings instead.
  - Probably not worth it, could get confusing using vim & emacs at the same time.
